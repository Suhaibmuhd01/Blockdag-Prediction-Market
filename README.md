# PredictMarket - Decentralized Prediction Markets dApp

A production-ready prediction market platform built for hackathons. Users can create binary prediction markets, stake ERC20 tokens (testnet USDC), and earn rewards based on correct predictions.

## üèÜ Hackathon Features

### Core Functionality

- **Create Markets**: Binary Yes/No prediction markets with customizable durations
- **Stake & Trade**: ERC20 token staking with real-time odds calculation  
- **Resolve & Withdraw**: Market resolution and automatic winner payouts
- **Real-time Updates**: Live market data with WebSocket-like polling

### Technical Excellence 

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity ^0.8.24 with OpenZeppelin security
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind with wallet integration
- **Security**: ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, comprehensive access controls
- **Testing**: Full test coverage with Hardhat + Chai

### UX/UI Excellence

- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design with glass-morphism effects
- **Animations**: Framer Motion micro-interactions and transitions  
- **Dark Mode**: Full theme support with Darkify integration
- **Wallet Integration**: RainbowKit + Wagmi for seamless Web3 UX

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- MetaMask or compatible wallet

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local blockchain + deploy contracts + start frontend
npm run demo
```

This single command:
1. Starts a local Hardhat node
2. Deploys contracts with test data  
3. Launches the React frontend
4. Pre-funds test accounts with USDC

### Manual Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install
cd contracts && npm install && cd ..

# 2. Compile contracts
npm run compile

# 3. Run tests
npm run test

# 4. Start local node (in separate terminal)
npm run node

# 5. Deploy contracts (in separate terminal)
npm run deploy:local

# 6. Start frontend
npm run dev
```

## üì± Testing the App

### Getting Test Funds

1. Connect your wallet to the app
2. Use the built-in faucet to get 1000 USDC
3. Switch to localhost:8545 network in MetaMask

### Demo Flow

1. **Create Market**: Click "Create New Market" and add a question
2. **Stake Tokens**: Click on a market to view details and place stakes
3. **View Odds**: Watch real-time odds updates as users stake
4. **Resolve Market**: Market creators can resolve after end time
5. **Withdraw Winnings**: Winners can claim their rewards

### Test Accounts (Pre-funded)

- Account 0: `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`
- Account 1: `0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8`
- Account 2: `0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC`

Each account has 10,000 USDC for testing.

## üîß Architecture

### Smart Contracts (`/contracts`)

- **MarketFactory.sol**: Creates and manages all markets
- **Market.sol**: Individual market logic (staking, resolution, withdrawals)
- **MockERC20.sol**: Test USDC token with faucet functionality

### Frontend (`/src`)

- **Components**: Modular React components with TypeScript
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for contract interactions
- **Config**: Wagmi and RainbowKit configuration
- **Contracts**: ABIs and deployment addresses

### Key Technologies

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Web3**: Wagmi, RainbowKit, Ethers.js
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **State**: React Query for async state management

## üîí Security

### Smart Contract Security

- ‚úÖ ReentrancyGuard on all external functions
- ‚úÖ SafeERC20 for secure token transfers  
- ‚úÖ Access controls (Ownable, creator permissions)
- ‚úÖ Input validation and bounds checking
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)

### Known Security Considerations

- Manual market resolution (use Chainlink oracles in production)
- Creator privilege in resolution (consider DAO governance)
- No dispute mechanism (add arbitration for production)

## üìä Testing & Coverage

### Run All Tests

```bash
cd contracts
npm test
```

### Expected Test Output

```bash
  PredictionMarket
    MarketFactory
      ‚úì Should deploy with correct staking token
      ‚úì Should create a new market
      ‚úì Should reject invalid market creation

    Market Operations
      ‚úì Should allow users to stake on Yes
      ‚úì Should allow users to stake on No
      ‚úì Should calculate correct odds
      ‚úì Should not allow staking after market ends

    Market Resolution & Withdrawal
      ‚úì Should resolve market correctly
      ‚úì Should calculate winnings correctly for Yes outcome
      ‚úì Should allow winners to withdraw
      ‚úì Should not allow withdrawal before resolution

## üåê Deployment

### Sepolia Testnet

1. Set up environment variables in `contracts/.env`:
```bash
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-key
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

2. Deploy:
```bash
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

3. Update contract addresses in `src/contracts/addresses.json`

### Mainnet Considerations

- Replace MockERC20 with real USDC contract
- Implement oracle-based resolution (Chainlink)
- Add governance for dispute resolution
- Conduct professional security audit

## üéØ Demo Script (8-10 minutes)

### Slide 1: Problem & Solution

- **Problem**: Traditional prediction markets are centralized and restrictive
- **Solution**: Decentralized, permissionless markets with crypto incentives

### Slide 2: Technical Architecture

- Smart contracts on Ethereum with OpenZeppelin security
- React frontend with Web3 wallet integration
- Real-time market data and responsive UX

### Slide 3: Live Demo - Create Market

- Connect wallet and show balance
- Create new market: "Will ETH reach $5000 by March 2024?"
- Show transaction confirmation and market creation

### Slide 4: Live Demo - Trading

- Stake 100 USDC on "YES" 
- Switch accounts, stake 200 USDC on "NO"
- Show real-time odds calculation (33% YES, 67% NO)

### Slide 5: Live Demo - Resolution & Rewards

- Fast-forward time to market end
- Resolve market as "YES" winner
- Show winning calculation: 100 + (100/200 * 200) = 300 USDC
